## About CSE344

**[CSE344: *Computer Vision*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE344)** is a 3xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSAI discipline at IIIT-Delhi. The course deals with the theoretical and practical concepts of well-established computer vision techniques. It aims to:

- introduce to the students learning problems and techniques to solve them
- enable students to evaluate the performance of different computer vision models quantitatively, analyze them, and comment on their limitations
- enable students to identify and use advanced techniques using existing tools and CV libraries
